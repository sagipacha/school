<h1>Emily Thorne</h1>
<h6>Revenge <small>2011</small></h6>
<p>Emily Thorne arrives in the Hamptons and rents a beach house near the Grayson family estate for the summer.<br>
    Emily's real name is actually Amanda Clarke, whose father, David Clarke, was convicted of treason when she was
    little.<br>
    After a long trial, he was sentenced to life imprisonment, and was murdered in prison by the people who framed
    him. <br>
    Amanda was separated from him after his trial and has not seen him since. <br>
    Now, she's back in the Hamptons as a young woman in her late 20s to get revenge on whoever hurt her and her
    father.<br>
    Her main target is Victoria Grayson, the illustrious mother of the Grayson family, who had an affair with David
    and then turned him in to the police.
